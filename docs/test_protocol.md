```

**Results:**
- Each byte transmitted with 50ms delay
- Transmission confirmed via debug output
- No response data received after 10.0 seconds timeout
- Total bytes transmitted: 10
- Total bytes received: 0

**Conclusion:**
Timing adjustment ineffective. No device response detected.

### T-003: Hardware Signal Verification

- Test pattern successfully transmitted
- Loopback detection attempted
- No response data received

**Conclusion:**
Hardware interface appears operational for transmission. Reception path requires verification.

### T-004: Protocol Sequence Simulation

**Parameters:**
- Protocol version: V2.3
- Command set: Full initialization sequence with movement commands

**Commands Executed:**
```
python3 src/pantilt_simulator.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --debug
```

**Results:**
- Complete protocol sequence transmitted
- 47 bytes transmitted in correct sequence
- Escape character handling verified
- No response data received after 8.0 seconds timeout

**Conclusion:**
Protocol simulation unsuccessful in establishing communication. Device non-responsive.

### T-005: Manual Command Transmission

**Parameters:**
- Interactive mode
- Manual timing control

**Commands Executed:**
```
python3 src/hex_terminal.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

**Command Sequence:**
1. `init` (Initialization command)
2. `hb` (Heartbeat command)
3. `byte 3C` (Start marker)
4. `byte 53` (Command identifier)
5. `byte 50` (Parameter)
6. `byte 01` (Value)
7. `byte 7C` (End marker)

**Results:**
- All commands transmitted successfully
- Manual timing adjustments attempted
- Multiple command variations tested
- No response data received

**Conclusion:**
Manual intervention unsuccessful in establishing communication.

### T-006: Alternative Timing Patterns

**Parameters:**
- Variable timing patterns
- Extended timeouts
- Multiple initialization strategies

**Commands Executed:**
```
python3 src/pantilt_protocol.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --debug
```

**Results:**
- 8 timing variations tested
- 3 initialization strategies attempted
- Extended timeout periods implemented (up to 30.0 seconds)
- No response data received

**Conclusion:**
Alternative protocol timing ineffective. Device remains non-responsive.

## Technical Analysis

**Summary of Findings:**

The test series demonstrates consistent non-responsiveness from the pan-tilt unit across multiple communication methodologies. The primary observation is complete absence of data reception despite confirmed transmission capability.

**Hypothesis:**

1. Signal level incompatibility between interface and device
2. Signal path interruption in the RX direction
3. Device power state insufficient for communication
4. Internal firmware non-functional

**Verification Steps Required:**

1. Signal level measurement with oscilloscope on TX/RX lines
2. Connection verification with continuity tester
3. Power supply verification under load conditions
4. Alternative hardware implementation testing

## Recommendation

Based on the systematic test results, hardware-level investigation is recommended. Software implementation appears correct according to documented protocol specifications. Hardware interface verification should proceed according to procedures outlined in the test manual document.
